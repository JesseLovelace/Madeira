# Steam Cloud saves

Madeira syncs the save files of installed Steam games with the signed-in
account's Steam Cloud. It uses the app's own Steam connection (the one the
library and downloads use, `docs/STEAM_LIBRARY.md`), so it only ever runs
while no game session holds the account.

`env.MADEIRA_STEAM_CLOUD = 0` turns the feature off.
`env.MADEIRA_STEAM_CLOUD_AUTO = 0` keeps the comparison and the game page
but copies nothing in either direction unless the user asks there.

## When it runs

- Once when Madeira starts, for every installed Steam game.
- When a Steam game's details page opens, and on its **Sync now** button.

- On **Upload saves and close Madeira** in the game menu of a running Steam
  game.

Madeira cannot close a game: the user leaves one by quitting the app. So
there is no sync at exit. What was played is uploaded at the next start,
unless the menu button sent it first.

The button works while the game still runs. Madeira's own Steam connection
is closed for a session, because a second logon replaces the first; the
button logs Madeira on again, which ends the logon of Valve's client in the
session, and the app quits once the upload is confirmed. It only uploads:
files that changed on this device and not in the cloud. It waits until two
looks 2 s apart find the same device files, since the game may be writing.
A file that also changed in the cloud is not sent without the user choosing
to replace the cloud's copy. On any failure the app stays open and says so.
`env.MADEIRA_STEAM_CLOUD_QUIT = 0` hides the button.

## Before a game starts

Play checks the game's cloud state first (`env.MADEIRA_STEAM_CLOUD_PLAY_CHECK = 0`
turns this off):

- In sync, checked in the last 10 minutes: the game starts.
- Checked longer ago: the saves are synced again, then the game starts.
- A check or transfer is running: an alert offers **Wait and sync** (the game
  starts when it finishes) or **Launch anyway**.
- The check failed or has not run (no network, for example): **Try again**
  or **Launch anyway**.
- Saves wait for a choice: **Choose** opens the game's page, or **Launch
  anyway**.

A start interrupts a running download between files, never inside one: each
file is written whole.

## What it does

1. Asks Steam for the app's cloud file list (`Cloud.GetAppFileChangelist`).
2. Maps each cloud path to a file of Madeira Dock's Wine prefix, through
   the `%Root%` placeholder of the path and the app's `ufs` product info:
   `GameInstall` is the game's folder, `WinAppDataLocalLow` and its
   siblings are under the Windows user folder (the one Wine names after
   `$USER`), and a path with no placeholder is under Steam's
   `userdata/<account>/<app>/remote`. Names are matched without regard to
   case. A path that would leave its folder is refused.
3. Compares SHA-1 and size, and also lists files matching the app's save
   patterns that the cloud does not have.
4. Looks each file up in its record of what was last identical on both
   sides (`steam-cloud-sync.json` in Application Support):
   - changed on one side only, or new on one side: copied to the other;
   - changed on both, or different with no record: **left alone**. The
     start-up check names the games, and the game's page shows each such
     save with both dates and sizes and asks which side to keep;
   - present in the record but now missing on one side: left alone (never
     deleted on the other side, never brought back).

## Safety

- A downloaded file is checked against the SHA-1 in Steam's list before
  anything is written.
- A file a download replaces is first copied to
  `Application Support/Madeira/steam-cloud-backups/<app>/<time>/`.
- Steam keeps no copy of a cloud file an upload replaces, which is why an
  upload over a differing cloud file only happens on the user's choice or
  when the record shows the cloud copy is the one this device last synced.
- Nothing is ever deleted in the cloud.

## Limits

- No download while a game runs, no upload except by the menu button, and no sync between pressing Play and the game
  starting: a cloud save newer than the device's that had not come down yet
  becomes a choice at the next start.
- A game whose Windows saves are redirected by a `rootoverrides` entry for
  Windows is compared and downloaded, but new device files there are not
  uploaded.
- Encrypted cloud files are not supported.
- Log tag `[steam-cloud]`: App IDs, counts, and save file names under
  their Steam folder names. Never account data or the Windows user name.
